# citymap

## Intro

Search places on a map, filtering by City Boundaries.

I recently wrote a 5 part series that shows how to do mapping, and searching which can be filtered to within City Boundaries. I use Vue.js, Google Maps and Places, GeoJSON, and polygon filtering.  Citymap is a stripped down blend of a bunch of small parts.  I dont claim for it to be a shining illustration of UI, component layout, or error checking.  It's an end to end example, done in limited time.
